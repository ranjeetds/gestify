```

## 🎯 Which Version Should I Use?

### Use Basic `gestify.py` if:
- ✅ You want maximum speed (40-50 FPS)
- ✅ Basic 7 gestures are enough
- ✅ You don't need AI
- ✅ You want simplest setup

### Use Enhanced `gestify_enhanced.py` if:
- ✅ You want 15+ gestures
- ✅ You need zoom, wave, swipe, rotation
- ✅ You want Ollama AI option (already have model)
- ✅ Good balance of features and speed

### Use Enhanced + Qwen if:
- ✅ You want best AI recognition
- ✅ You have complex hand positions
- ✅ You don't mind 4.5GB download
- ✅ You're ok with 20-30 FPS
- ✅ You want state-of-the-art gesture AI

## 🔧 Configuration

### Toggle AI During Runtime

While running, press:
- **A** - Toggle AI assistance on/off
- **H** - Switch to Hugging Face Qwen
- **M** - Show all gestures
- **Q** - Quit

### Adjust Thresholds

Edit `gestify_enhanced.py`:

```python
# Line ~234 - Gesture thresholds
self.pinch_threshold = 0.04      # Lower = more sensitive
self.swipe_threshold = 150       # pixels for swipe
self.wave_threshold = 40         # pixels for wave
self.rotation_threshold = 15     # degrees for rotation
```

## 📊 Performance Tips

### For Maximum FPS:
1. Use basic version without AI
2. Close other camera apps
3. Good lighting
4. Lower camera resolution if needed

### For Best Accuracy:
1. Use Enhanced + Qwen
2. Good lighting is crucial
3. Show full hand including wrist
4. Smooth, deliberate movements
5. AI queries happen every 3 seconds

### For Balance:
1. Use Enhanced + Ollama
2. Toggle AI only when needed (press 'A')
3. 30-40 FPS with good accuracy

## 🎓 Learning the Gestures

### Step 1: Start Simple
```bash
python gestify_enhanced.py
```

Try in order:
1. Point (easiest)
2. Pinch (click)
3. Fist (drag)
4. Palm (release)

### Step 2: Add Scrolling
5. Peace sign (two fingers)
6. Move hand up/down to scroll

### Step 3: Advanced
7. Try wave (move wrist side to side)
8. Try swipe (fast lateral movement)
9. Try zoom (pinch and move fingers)
10. Try rotation (twist peace sign)

### Step 4: Enable AI
```bash
python gestify_enhanced.py --ai
# or press 'A' during runtime
```

Now try complex hand positions - AI will help!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Too many gestures triggering"
→ Increase cooldown in code (line ~228):
```python
self.action_cooldown = 0.5  # Increase from 0.2
```

### "Wave not detecting"
→ Move hand faster side-to-side
→ At least 2 direction changes needed

### "Rotation not working"
→ Use clear peace sign (✌️)
→ Rotate hand at least 15 degrees
→ Works best in Preview, Photos apps

### "Qwen model loading slow"
→ First load downloads 4.5GB (10-15 min)
→ Subsequent loads are fast (cached)
→ Close other apps to free memory

### "Low FPS with Qwen"
→ Normal! Expect 20-30 FPS
→ AI runs every 3 seconds, not every frame
→ MediaPipe still handles real-time tracking
