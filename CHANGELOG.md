### Improved - Hand Tracking
- **Direct Hand Tracking**: Cursor always follows index finger position
  - Removed gesture dependency for cursor movement
  - Natural mirror-mode control
  - Reduced latency (~40ms vs ~50ms)

- **Hysteresis Thresholds**: Stable pinch-and-hold
  - Different thresholds for grab (60px) vs release (90px)
  - 30px buffer zone prevents accidental drops
  - Smooth hand movement doesn't break hold

- **Multi-Hand Selection**: Intelligent hand filtering
  - Selects only 2 nearest/largest hands
  - Ignores background people
  - Allows hands to leave/enter frame gracefully

- **Smoothing Improvements**:
  - 5-frame history buffer for hand positions
  - 80/20 weighted averaging for paddle movement
  - 3-frame smoothing for cursor (reduced from 5)

### Fixed
- Mirror mode: Cursor now moves in correct direction
- Pinch stability: Objects don't drop during lateral hand movement
- Player assignment: Buffer zone prevents paddle swapping
- Hand coordination: Smooth paddle control without jitter

### Changed
- Consolidated documentation into single README.md
- Restructured as proper library with games as examples
- Updated project structure for better organization

## [2.0.0] - Previous Version

### Complete Architectural Rewrite

- Attention detection with face tracking
- Configurable modes (fast, accurate, two-hand)
- CLI tool and Python API
- Comprehensive documentation

### Core Features
- Hand detection with MediaPipe
- Face tracking and attention detection
- Gesture recognition with cooldown
- Action execution with PyAutoGUI
- UI rendering and feedback
- Robust camera initialization
- Error handling and cleanup
